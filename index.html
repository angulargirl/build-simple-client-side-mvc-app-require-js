RequireJS is a well known JavaScript module and file loader which is supported
in the latest versions of popular browsers. In RequireJS we separate code into
modules which each handle a single responsibility. Additionally, dependencies
need to be configured when loading files.

All the JavaScript files, including the RequireJS file, are located inside the
scripts folder. The file main.js is used for initialization, and the other files
contain application logic.

RequireJS uses main.js to look for other scripts and dependencies.
Attribute data-main tells where the main java script file that uses RequireJS is found
This is the only code required to include files using RequireJS:
-->
<script  data-main="js/main" src="bower_components/requirejs/require.js"></script>
<!--This sets the baseUrl to the "js" directory, and
    loads a script that will have a module ID of 'main'-->
